## What's NFT

NFT stand for non-... token.  
Sorry, I forget the full name. I will explain what it is in my understanding.
NFT is **A thing** which only existed on internet. It might be a picture, or a video, or just some data without any common format. Actually this blog is a NFT(And all my other blogs in this site, of course). Usually it present as an URL, and it can public.  
Now you might be confused why people pay tons of money buying something like this? I can download Steph Curry's Bored Ape and then copy paste and sell them for millions of dollars, right?

Well, you can't sell them. It's not that easy.  
## What's the core idea of NFT
The core idea of NFT (in my opinion) is that you show the world you **own** this thing.  
Like this blog you are reading of, it's also a NFT and is owned by me. The blog itself is just Markdown format data, and stored in IPFS(a decentralized file storage system). And a smart contract declare that this data belong to me.   
This is why you may heard about the 1st posted twitter can be sold as a NFT. Also twitter is a WEB2 platform, you can still sell the link of 1st twitter as a digital asset and claim that this link belongs to someone.

## Other features of NFT
- You can transfer you NFT, like you can give anything you owned to other people. In anther saying, you can sell your NFT.
- NFT can not be divided, you can not make you NFT to more than one pieces.
- NFT is unique. you can make a copy for the data, however, the data itself is an unique exist. You can make hundreds of NFT using the same data, but every single NFT is still be considered as unique.
  
## Why NFT
Why we need such complicated thing for a simple link or picture? Friend, this is the direction of WEB3. We claim our own property in WEB3. Did you have experience when you are banned on social media? Did you once shared a video and got deleted by platform? They can't if it's a NFT, because they don't have authority to do that. We may facing other problems like how to get rid of improper posts, but that's another topic. At least we won't let the guys making money with your creative to decide if you can keep your asset.
