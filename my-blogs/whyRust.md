## Why Rust

I am learning Rust recently. It's more difficult than I expect. I haven't even go through at least once in Rust tutorial, but I already can't wait to recommend this language to you.  

So first
### What's Rust
Of course, it's a programming language. I'd like to say it's the best programming language so far. Rust has taken number one of most loved language in developer's survey from 2016. It has the best security and great performance.  
Sounds like it has lots of advantages. How about the tradeoff? What's the weak points? Well, it's super difficult to learn. All your expertise in other languages will definitely help, but Rust will still make you recall your first year learning languages.

### Why should I learn this?
We already have tons of languages, right? Why Rust? I am living well without learning this.  
Well, you're right. You don't need to learn this. But please allow me to explain some benefits for learning Rust, you're in charge of making your own decision.  
Please not this list are benefits for **YOU**, not for Rust.

- Be a better coder  
	For learning Rust, you MUST knows deeply about memory, stack, heap, etc. These basic knowledge are handled by other high-level programming language, but here, you are controlling everything. It's sounds like a bad thing, right? Actually, it's not. In other languages with garbage collection built in, you never pay attention on these stuff, but have you experienced when bug is hide deeply in your code? In rust, if complier is satisfied with your code(which is quite hard, I'd say), then it's good.  
	So after you learn Rust, I am pretty sure you will write better code.
