## Why WEB3 
Before we talking about *What's is WEB3*, let's first talk about **Why WEB3**? Isn't our current web good enough? Well, actually it's pretty good but nothing is perfect, right?  
Human are chasing **Freedom** like forever, and WEB3 is definitely a step for it. Just think about these cases that WEB3 can solve:  
- You post your thought, that's your own property, no one can delete it.
- You will interact with public contract but not a mystery server. At least you know where your data goes to.
- Let's say you're a gamer, you spend thousands of dollars or hours on an online game. Next year you found a better game, you can sell your property in the game and using it on the new game.  
  
Basically you will own your stuff in WEB3, instead of tech companies.  
## What's WEB3
You might heard about the evolution about WEB1.0 to WEB2.0, I won't repeat them. My understanding for WEB3 is that WEB3 is holding data on blockchain. And blockchain is holding by servers all around the world instead of one. This means that WEB3 will be more stable and safe. No one can hack data on blockchain since it's impossible to hack thousands of computers.And there's always tradeoffs. For WEB3, all the data on blockchain is public. Although you are anonymous on WEB3, your data can be accessed by anyone.  
How does blockchain work? Imaging blockchain is continuous ledgers and is copied by everyone. Once you want to update the data in blockchain, the only thing you can do is to add a new ledger and ask everyone to add a new copy. So you bring up the new data, stand in public and say: "Hi, guys, I want to make some changes. Could you help me to copy this?". Then the blockchain system answered: "No problem. But wait a little while. Hello every, we got some work to do. Anyone can confirm this new ledger. Who did this work first can get some reward!" So 1st one has a chance to confirm this new change and get reward, others follow this copy and wait for next time.  
You may curious who decide the one to confirm the new block/ledger. Well, it's decided by different methods write in different blockchain system, and it's a big topic which we don't want to discuss here.
## How's WEB3 going right now?
This is a big topic. WEB3 is much more mature than couple of years before, but still needs a long way to go. Tons of issues need to be solve before it widespread to all people. For example, WEB3 want to decentralized everything, but lots of big names in WEB3 industry is centralized now. Big techs in WEB3 world are using private servers, client side code are hosted on servers. We still are looking forward to some better infrastructure in WEB3. We still need to balance legality and freedom for WEB3.   
Will the future be all WEB3 or only part of it? Nobody knows the answer, we'll see.  

## How to enter WEB3
For now, all you need is a crypto wallet. If you are looking this article, I'm sure you already are using MetaMask which is one of crypto wallets. Wallet contains some address, kind of like your deposit card. And for WEB3's content, you need show your card to interact with, like right now.  
This article is stored on IPFS (a decentralized file system), as a digital asset. If you read here, my friend, you already are in WEB3 world. :)
