## Why WEB3 
Before we talking about *What's is WEB3*, let's first talk about **Why WEB3**? Isn't our current web good enough? Well, actually it's pretty good but nothing is perfect, right?  
Human are chasing **Freedom** like forever, and WEB3 is definitely a step for it. Just think about these cases that WEB3 can solve:  
- You post your thought, that's your own property, no one can delete it.
- You will interact with public contract but not a mystery server. At least you know where your data goes to.
- Let's say you're a gamer, you spend thousands of dollars or hours on an online game. Next year you found a better game, you can sell your property in the game and using it on the new game.  
  
Basically you will own your stuff in WEB3, instead of tech companies.  

## What's WEB3
You might heard about the evolution about WEB1.0 to WEB2.0, I won't repeat them. My understanding for WEB3 is that WEB3 is holding data on blockchain. And blockchain is holding by servers all around the world instead of one. This means that WEB3 will be more stable and safe. No one can hack data on blockchain since it's impossible to hack thousands of computers.  
And there's always tradeoffs. For WEB3, all the data on blockchain is public. Although you are anonymous on WEB3, your data can be accessed by anyone.

## How's WEB3 going right now?
This is a big topic. WEB3 is much more mature than couple of years before, but still needs a long way to go. Tons of issues need to be solve before it widespread to all people. And will the future be all WEB3 or only part of it? Nobody knows the answer, we'll see.
